# 🧩 Palindrome Checker App
## Use Case 9 — Recursive Palindrome Checker

### 📌 Objective
To validate whether a string is a palindrome using recursion.

---

## 📖 Description

This implementation:

- Uses recursive method calls
- Compares characters from start and end
- Moves inward with each recursive call
- Stops when:
  - All characters match, or
  - A mismatch is found

This demonstrates divide-and-conquer logic using recursion.

---

## 🔑 Key Concepts Used

- Recursion
- Base condition
- Call stack behavior
- Divide-and-conquer approach

---

## ⚙️ Data Structure Used

- Call Stack (Implicit through recursion)

---

## ⏱ Complexity

Time Complexity: O(n)  
Space Complexity: O(n) (due to recursive call stack)

---

## 🖥 Sample Output

Input : madam  
Is Palindrome? : true

---

## ▶️ Compile & Run

Compile:
javac App/src/PalindromeChecker.java

Run:
java -cp App/src PalindromeChecker
